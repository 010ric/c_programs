Some C programs I wrote while enjoying my university course about operating systems

1.) Program : Hexdump a given File with arguments Pointer to FILE, length you want to dump and a                  char buffer, where you want the input to be stored.

2.) Program : Simple Shell Simulation, which sends user input to the kernel, and terminates when
              input == "exit"

3.) Program : LinkedList Implementation with functionality of insert, append and remove.
